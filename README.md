# Musical-Playlist-System
A C++ console-based Musical Playlist System implementing a Linked List for dynamic song management. It supports adding, deleting, displaying, and navigating tracks through a menu-driven interface. It demonstrates strong understanding of data structures, pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and structured program design.

# Features
Add new songs to the playlist
Delete songs from the playlist
Display all songs
Navigate through songs (next/previous)
Menu-driven user interface

# Technical Implementation
Each song is stored as a node in a Linked List containing song details and a pointer to the next node. Dynamic memory allocation is used to create and remove nodes during runtime. The program is structured using functions and follows Object-Oriented Programming principles for better modularity and clarity.

# Technologies Used
C++
Linked List (Data Structures)
Object-Oriented Programming
Dynamic Memory Allocation
Visual Studio Code

# How to Run
Compile the program using any C++ compiler (Example: Visual Studio Code).
Run the executable file.
Use the menu options to manage the playlist.
